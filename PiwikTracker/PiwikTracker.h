/**
 
 The PiwikTracker is an Objective-C framework (iOS and OSX) for sending analytics to a Piwik server.
 
 Piwik server is a downloadable, Free/Libre (GPLv3 licensed) real time web analytics software, [http://piwik.org](http://piwik.org).
 This framework implements the Piwik tracking REST API [http://piwik.org/docs/tracking-api/reference.](http://piwik.org/docs/tracking-api/reference/)
 
 ###How does it work
 
 1. Create and configure the tracker
 2. Track screen views, events, errors, social interaction, search and goals
 3. Let the dispatch timer dispatch pending events to the Piwik server or start the dispatch manually


 All events are persisted locally in Core Data until they are dispatched and successfully received by the Piwik server.
 
 All methods are asynchronous and will return immediately.

 The user will be asked for permission to use current location when the first event is sent. The user can also disable the location service from the Settings location.
 
 Think about users privacy. Provide information why their location is tracked and give the user the option to opt out.
 
 Turning this ON will potentially use more battery power. The tracker will only react to significant location changes to reduce battery impact. Location changes will not be tracked when the app is terminated or running in the background.
