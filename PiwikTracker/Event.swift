/// - Note: Should we store the resolution in the Event (cleaner) or add it before transmission (smaller)?
/// - Todo: 
///     - Add Campaign Parameters: _rcn, _rck
///     - Add Action info
///     - Event Tracking info
///     - Add Content Tracking info
///     - Add Ecommerce info

/// # Key Mapping:
/// Most properties represent a key defined at: [Tracking HTTP API](https://developer.piwik.org/api-reference/tracking-api). Keys that are not supported for now are:
///
/// - idsite, rec, rand, apiv, res, cookie,
/// - All Plugins: fla, java, dir, qt, realp, pdf, wma, gears, ag
/// - cid: We will use the uid instead of the cid.
/// - dimension: For now we don't support dimension.
/// - UserAgent (ua) should be set in the dispatcher, right?
