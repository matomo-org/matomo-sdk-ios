# PiwikTracker iOS SDK

The PiwikTracker is an iOS, tvOS and macOS SDK for sending app analytics to a Piwik server.

**Fancy help improving this SDK? Check [this list](https://github.com/piwik/piwik-sdk-ios/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3Adiscussion%20label%3Aswift3) to see what is left and can be improved.**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/piwik/piwik-sdk-ios.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/piwik/piwik-sdk-ios)

## Installation
### [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

Use the following in your Podfile.

```
pod 'PiwikTracker', '~> 4.1.0'
```

Then run `pod install`. In every file you want to use the PiwikTracker, don't forget to import the framwork with `import PiwikTracker`.

## Usage
### Configuration

Befor the first usage, the PiwikTracker has to be configured. This is best to be done in the `application(_:, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method in the `AppDelegate`.

```
PiwikTracker.configureSharedInstance(withSiteID: "5", baseURL: URL(string: "http://your.server.org/path-to-piwik/piwik.php")!)
```

The `siteId` is the id that you can get if you [add a website](https://piwik.org/docs/manage-websites/#add-a-website) within the Piwik web interface. The `baseURL` it the URL to your Piwik web instance and has to include the "piwik.php" string.

#### OptOut

The PiwikTracker SDK supports opting out of tracking. Please use the `isOptedOut` property of the PiwikTracker to define if the user opted out of tracking.

```
PiwikTracker.shared?.isOptedOut = true
```

### Tracking Page Views

The PiwikTracker can track hierarchical screen names, e.g. screen/settings/register. Use this to create a hierarchical and logical grouping of screen views in the Piwik web interface.

```
PiwikTracker.shared?.track(view: ["path","to","your","page"])
```

You can also set the url of the page. 
```
let url = URL(string: "https://piwik.org/get-involved/")
PiwikTracker.shared?.track(view: ["community","get-involved"], url: url)
```

### Tracking Events

Events can be used to track user interactions such as taps on a button. An event consists of four parts:

- Category
- Action
- Name (optional, recommended)
- Value (optional)

```
PiwikTracker.shared?.track(eventWithCategory: "player", action: "slide", name: "volume", value: 35.1)
```

This will log that the user slided the volume slider on the player to 35.1%.

### Custom Dimension

The Piwik SDK currently supports Custom Dimensions for the Visit Scope. Using Custom Dimensions you can add properties to the whole visit, such as "Did the user finish the tutorial?", "Is the user a paying user?" or "Which version of the Application is being used?" and such. Before sending custom dimensions please make sure Custom Dimensions are [properly installed and configured](https://piwik.org/docs/custom-dimensions/). You will need the `ID` of your configured Dimension.

After that you can set a new Dimension,

```
PiwikTracker.shared?.set(value: "1.0.0-beta2", forIndex: 1)
```

or remove an already set dimension.

```
PiwikTracker.shared?.remove(dimensionAtIndex: 1)
```

Dimensions in the Visit Scope will be sent along every Page View or Event. Custom Dimensions are not persisted by the SDK and have to be re-configured upon application startup.

### Advanced

#### Manual dispatching

The PiwikTracker will dispatch events every 30 seconds automatically. If you want to dispatch events manually, you can use the `dispatch()` function. You can, for example, dispatch whenever the application enter the background.

```
func applicationDidEnterBackground(_ application: UIApplication) {
  PiwikTracker.shared?.dispatch()
}
```

#### Session Management

The PiwikTracker starts a new session whenever the application starts. If you want to start a new session manually, you can use the `startNewSession()` function. You can, for example, start a new session whenever the user enters the application.

```
func applicationWillEnterForeground(_ application: UIApplication) {
  PiwikTracker.shared?.startNewSession()
}
```

#### Logging

The PiwikTracker per default loggs `warning` and `error` messages to the console. You can change the `LogLevel`.

```
PiwikTracker.shared?.logger = DefaultLogger(minLevel: .verbose)
PiwikTracker.shared?.logger = DefaultLogger(minLevel: .debug)
PiwikTracker.shared?.logger = DefaultLogger(minLevel: .info)
PiwikTracker.shared?.logger = DefaultLogger(minLevel: .warning)
PiwikTracker.shared?.logger = DefaultLogger(minLevel: .error)
```

You can also write your own `Logger` and send the logs whereever you want. Just write a new class/struct an let it conform to the `Logger` protocol.

### Custom User Agent
You can now use custom user agent of `PiwikTracker`. Add a parameter for custom user agent in the constructor of `PiwikTracker`.

**BTW, be notice, `PiwikTracker` will create a default user agent by creating a web view if you didn't pass the custom one. In another words, you should create instance of `PiwikTracker` in the main thread.**
